title: Windowing for Driver Maximization

---

When constructing the outage prediction model, we make the assumption that outages are caused primarily by high intensity drivers causing disruptions which lead to outages. 

Outage events are sorted into individual days. For storm events, the distinction of days is arbitrary. This file introduces a method for windowing a 24-hour period before and after an outage event is recorded (for a 48 hour window) and identifying the maximum values for drivers.

``` {python}
#| echo: false

# Package Import
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd

# Data Import

gdf = gpd.read_file('../data/outage_shapefile_merge/outage_shapefile_merge.shp')

gdf = gdf.rename(columns={'customers_': 'customers_affected', 'duration_m': 'duration_minutes', 'index_righ': 'index_right'}) # Correct buggy names from export

outage_gdf = gdf[gdf['customers_affected'] > 1] # Remove "fluke" events

```



``` {python}


```
