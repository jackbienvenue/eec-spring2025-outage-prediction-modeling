We will begin the data cleaning process by transitioning GRIB files into dataframes so that we can later collect them into a single CSV for further analysis.

GRIB files tend to be very tricky, and in our GRIB files I have found a persistent issue that comes when opening and reading them. This occurs, I presume, because there are two internal "step" (interval) systems being used, a 1-hour step, and a 24-hour step.

Below, I discovered a way to work around the issue by reading in a GRIB file with the backend keyword argument solved for the step lengths.



```{python}
# Set the GRIB file path:

grib_path = "../data/data_CT/download_ERA5_LAND_package_1982_10.grib"

# Read in hourly data by using 1-hour intervals:

hourly_data = cfgrib.open_dataset(grib_path, backend_kwargs={'filter_by_keys': {'typeOfLevel': 'surface', 'step': 1}})

# Read in daily data by using 24-hour intervals:

daily_data = cfgrib.open_dataset(grib_path, backend_kwargs={'filter_by_keys': {'typeOfLevel': 'surface', 'step': 24}})

# Now, print these as dataframes:

hourly_df = hourly_data.to_dataframe()
daily_df = daily_data.to_dataframe()

# Let's see more rows to check for NaN's:

pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 100)

# Display dataframes (if you would like to see them)
#####display(hourly_df)
#####display(daily_df)

# Count NaNs in column of new dfs:

nan_count = daily_df['t2m'].isna().sum()

# Print count of NAs in column:

print('Count of NaNs:', nan_count)
```

Across the daily & hourly dfs and over the time series, there seems to be always be a nan_count of 1550. Let's investigate this.


### APPENDIX:

#### Error - skipping variables:

Error mentions 'skt', short name for variable "Skin Temperature"---"This parameter is the temperature of the surface of the Earth.

The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. It represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which has no heat capacity and so can respond instantaneously to changes in surface fluxes. Skin temperature is calculated differently over land and sea.""

Also, it skips 'rsn', 'sd', 'src'
