title: Associating Outages with Grid Cells

In this file, we will join the outage data spatially with the grid cells in order to associate outages with specific grid cells for spatial analysis.

``` {python}
#| echo: false

# Package Import
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import folium
from folium import Choropleth
import numpy as np

# Data Import
grid_cells = gpd.read_file("../data/grid_cell_shapefile/grid_cells.shp")
outage_df = pd.read_csv("../data/outage_data.csv")
```

``` {python}
# Convert the outage dataframe to a geodataframe
outage_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(outage_df, 
                              geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(outage_df['longitude'], outage_df['latitude']),
                              crs=grid_cells.crs)  # Ensure both datasets have the same CRS
# Perform join
joined_gdf = gpd.sjoin(outage_gdf, grid_cells, how="left", predicate="within")

print(joined_gdf.head())

joined_gdf.to_file('../data/outage_shapefile_merge/outage_shapefile_merge.shp')
```

Now that we have created the new geodataframe associated each outage with a grid cell, let's map it out to confirm that we are experiencing the intended effects:

``` {python}
outage_counts = joined_gdf.groupby('index_right').size()

grid_cells['log_outage_count'] = np.log(grid_cells.index.map(outage_counts).fillna(1))

import folium

map_center = [41.6433, -72.6472] 

# Create the folium map centered at the provided coordinates
m = folium.Map(location=map_center, zoom_start=10)

# Your Choropleth layer
folium.Choropleth(
    geo_data=grid_cells,
    name="Log Outage Count",
    data=grid_cells,
    columns=["FID", "log_outage_count"],
    key_on="feature.id",
    fill_color="Blues",
    fill_opacity=0.7,
    line_opacity=0.2,
    legend_name="Log Outage Count"
).add_to(m)

# Add layer control
folium.LayerControl().add_to(m)

m

```

``` {python}
outage_counts = joined_gdf.groupby('index_right').size()

grid_cells['outage_count'] = grid_cells.index.map(outage_counts).fillna(1)

map_center = grid_cells.geometry.centroid.unary_union.centroid.coords[:]

map_center = [41.6433, -72.6472]

m = folium.Map(location=map_center, zoom_start=10)

folium.Choropleth(
    geo_data=grid_cells,
    name="Outage Count",
    data=grid_cells,
    columns=["FID", "outage_count"],
    key_on="feature.id",
    fill_color="Blues",
    fill_opacity=0.7,
    line_opacity=0.2,
    legend_name="Outage Count"
).add_to(m)

folium.LayerControl().add_to(m)

m
```
