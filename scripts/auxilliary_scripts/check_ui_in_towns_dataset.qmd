In this file, we want to evaluate whether UI (United Illuminating) towns are underrepresented in our datasets:

``` {python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("../data/outages_per_town_CT.csv")
```

Let's check Vernon, a ~45,000 population town in the Eversource area:

``` {python}
vernon_df = df[df["town"] == "Vernon"]

vernon_df_outages_count = sum(vernon_df['customers_affected'])
print(vernon_df_outages_count)
```

Now, let's check Wallingford, a ~45,000 population town in the UI area:

``` {python}
wallingford_df = df[df["town"] == "Wallingford"]

wallingford_df_outages_count = sum(wallingford_df['customers_affected'])
print(wallingford_df_outages_count)
```
