In this file, we will make some codes to visualize the time series data we gathered from converting the *.grib* files into individual grid cell 

``` {python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

# Package Import
import pandas as pd

# Data Import
df = pd.read_csv("../data/individual_csvs_daily/lat_41_281_lon_-73_62795_time_series_weather.csv")
    ##### Example CSV to be observed
```

IDEA: Animated map of grid cells, time series of variables
