In this file, we will make some codes to visualize the time series data we gathered from converting the *.grib* files into individual grid cells.

``` {python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

# Package Import
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
import seaborn as sns

# Data Import
df = pd.read_csv("../data/individual_csvs_daily/lat_41_281_lon_-73_62795_time_series_weather.csv")
    ##### Example CSV to be observed
```

Let's go ahead and begin working on plots. The first one can be of the temperature over time. We can do this in the following way:

``` {python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

# Ensure 'time' column is in datetime format
df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['time'])

# Create the interactive plot
fig = px.line(df, x='time', y='t2m', title='Temperature at 2 Meter Elevation over Time')

# Show the interactive plot
fig.show()

```

IDEA: Animated map of grid cells, time series of variables
