## Progress

- Developed function to automatically process desired subsets of *.GRIB* into grid-cell specific CSVs

``` {python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

grib_folder_processing(earliest_file, latest_file, 
    input_directory, output_directory_path, hourly=False)

'''
earliest_file - the EARLIEST chronological file

latest_file - the LATEST chronological file

input_directory - input directory which hosts the files

output_directory_path - output path for the NEW directory that 
    is meant to store the new, grid-cell-specific CSVs

hourly - whether or not to export data at an hourly resolution
'''
```

## Progress, continued

- Created aggregation functions 
- Learned to make animated map of weather 


## Plans

- Process larger subsets of hourly data into 
- Make 

## Questions

- Which aggregations are the most useful for drivers over a daily period?
    - Wind speed: average, max, average of top quantile?
- Are there particular visualizations I can make which can be useful to the project for reporting?
