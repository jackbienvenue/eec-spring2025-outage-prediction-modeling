``` {python}
#| echo: false

# Package import
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data import
df = pd.read_csv("/Volumes/JB_Fortress_L3/EEC/aggregated_csvs/lat_41_981_lon_-72_52737_time_series_weather.csv")
```

Let's check on the distribution of different precipitation levels. We want to look at individual days and create a histogram to represent the frequency of different precipitation levels to see if a clear separation emerges in terms of stormy days and relatively normal days. Let's try this. Note that the following is for a arbitrarily selected grid cell:

``` {python}
plt.hist(df['total_precipitation'], bins = 50, color = 'skyblue', range = (0,0.1)) # ARBITRARY RANGE, CUTS OFF DATA

plt.title("Frequency of Daily Precipitation Totals")
plt.xlabel("Total Precipitation (m)")
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
```
